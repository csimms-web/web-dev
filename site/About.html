  <section id="mission"><i>“We beleive that vaping has the potential to be significantly less risky than smoking due to the fact that it does not contain tobacco and does not produce tobacco smoke or many of the chemicals in it. We and many in the public health community believe that vapour products reduce risk compared to cigarettes and should be available to help adults stop smoking and enjoy nicotine. We believe in a science led dicussion of vaping and the effects on health. We believe along with Public Health England that ‘vaping poses only a small fraction of the risks of smoking and switching completely from smoking to vaping conveys substantial health benefits.”</i></section>
